# Graph_components
an algorithm that separates graph into groups based on conectivity
 if u have graph like this : A-B-C   D-F   G-Q-W , (a graph with three ailent) it will return this  [A,B,C],[D,F],[Q,W,G] .
 the Graph must be in a file like this : (head,tail,relation)  . ( this format is for Knowledge Graphs)
 the return array is stored in "graph_bfs" variable
 time complexity is n^4
